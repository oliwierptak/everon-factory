# everon-factory
Beta version

# Everon Factory v0.5
Library to handle dependency injection and instantiation. Allows to produce code that is easy to test.

## Requirements
* Php 5.5+

## Features
* One line, lazy loaded dependency injection (via setters or constructors)
* Trait based, simple to use and implement, no hassle with config files, pure PHP
* Factory/FactoryWorker gives full control and overview, on how each and every object is created
* FactoryWorker allows for custom implementation of Factory methods
* Full control when a dependency should be reused or created from scratch, with Dependency Container (eg. Logger vs Value Object)
* Minimized file/memory access/usage due to callbacks and lazy load
* Intuitive Interface: clear, small and simple API
* Convention over configuration
* Clean code

## How it works
Every instantiation should happen only inside of the ```FactoryWorker``` class.
What it means, is that almost every usage of ```new``` operator should happen there.
It's easy to implement and manage, because injection is cheap and dependency setup happens in one place.

This makes testing much easier, as everything can be easily mocked/stubbed/faked.
It's ok to use ```new``` operator outside of Factory methods for simple value object like classes.

For a particular module or application, the ```registerBeforeWork``` method  of ```FactoryWorker``` is one of a places where you could setup your dependency tree.
Or you could use [Root Composition pattern](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/07/28/CompositionRoot/) and handle your whole dependency graph outside of your application.

### Easy Dependency Injection
To use dependency injection, register it with ```Dependency Container``` and use one line trait to inject it.

For example, this will inject a predefined ```Logger``` instance via setter injection into ```Foo``` class.
```php
class Foo
{
    use Dependency\Setter\Logger;
}
```

### Register with Dependency Container
Use ```register``` method to register Logger dependency under ```Logger``` name.

```php
$Container->register('Logger', function () use ($FactoryWorker) {
    return $FactoryWorker->buildLogger();
});
```

### Define the traits and interface
Example of ```Logger``` dependency trait, which is reused between all of the classes that use ```Dependency\Setter\Logger``` trait.
The only thing to remember is that, the name of the trait should be the same,
as the name under which the dependency was registered with the ```Dependency Container```.


```php
trait Logger
{
    /**
     * @var LoggerInterface
     */
    protected $Logger;

    /**
     * @inheritdoc
     */
    public function getLogger()
    {
        return $this->Logger;
    }

    /**
     * @inheritdoc
     */
    public function setLogger(LoggerInterface $Logger)
    {
        $this->Logger = $Logger;
    }
}
```

Bonus: You can also define and assign the ```LoggerAwareInterface``` too all classes that are being injected with ```Logger``` instance.
```php
interface LoggerAwareInterface
{
    /**
     * @return LoggerInterface
     */
    public function getLogger();

    /**
     * @param Logger LoggerInterface
     */
    public function setLogger(LoggerInterface $Logger);
}
```

Define the setter injection trait.
The only requirement is that the name ends with ```Dependency\Setter\<dependency name>```.
You can reuse already defined ```Dependency\Logger``` trait, in every class that implements LoggerAwareInterface.


```php
namespace MyApplication\Modules\Logger\Dependency\Setter;

use MyApplication\Modules\Logger\Dependency;

trait Logger
{
    use Dependency\Logger;
}
```


### Resolve with Dependency Container
Use ```resolve``` to receive dependency defined earlier with ```register``` or ```propose```.
So you can pass the same instance to another class via constructor injection.


```php
$Container->register('Application', function () use ($FactoryWorker) {
    $Logger = $FactoryWorker->getFactory()->getDependencyContainer()->resolve('Logger');
    return $FactoryWorker->buildApplication($Logger);
});
```

### Build with FactoryWorker
To build your dependencies use the ```FactoryWorker``` classes.

```php
class MyApplicationFactoryWorker extends AbstractWorker implements FactoryWorkerInterface
{
    /**
     * @inheritdoc
     */
    protected function registerBeforeWork()
    {
        $Factory = $this->getFactory();
        $this->getFactory()->getDependencyContainer()->propose('MyApplicationFactoryWorker', function () use ($Factory) {
            return $Factory->getWorkerByName('MyApplication', 'MyApplication\Modules\Application\Factory');
        });
    }

    /**
     * @param string $namespace
     *
     * @return Foo
     */
    public function buildLogger($namespace = 'MyApplication\Modules\Logger')
    {
        return $this->getFactory()->buildWithEmptyConstructor('Logger', $namespace);
    }

    /**
     * @param LoggerInterface $Logger
     * @param string $anotherArgument
     * @param array $data
     * @param string $namespace
     *
     * @return Application
     */
    public function buildApplication(LoggerInterface $Logger, $namespace = 'MyApplication\Modules\Application')
    {
        return $this->getFactory()->buildWithConstructorParameters('Application', $namespace,
            $this->buildParameterCollection([
                $Logger,
            ])
        );
    }

    /**
     * @param RepositoryInterface $UserRepository
     * @param LoggerInterface $Logger
     * @param string $namespace
     *
     * @return Application
     */
    public function buildUserManager(RepositoryInterface $UserRepository, LoggerInterface $Logger, $namespace = 'MyApplication\Modules\Application')
    {
        return $this->getFactory()->buildWithConstructorParameters('UserManager', $namespace,
            $this->buildParameterCollection([
                $UserRepository,
                $Logger
            ])
        );
    }
}
```
Now ```Application``` and ```UserManager``` will share the same instance of ```Logger``` class.

```php
$Application->getLogger()->log('It works');
$UserManager->getLogger()->log('It works, too');
```

If you don't do any work in constructors, and you shouldn't, and only require the ```Logger``` functionality later, it would be easier
to just use the ```Logger``` as the infrastructure type dependency and just inject it via setter injection with one line.

```php
class Application
{
    use Dependency\Setter\Logger;
}
```

The end result is the same.

**Every required class will be injected with the same ```Logger``` instance,
that was registered with the ```Dependency Container``` and build by ```FactoryWorker``` in ```Factory```.**


### Ensures Tests Ready Code (tm)
Writing tests of classes that use ```Everon Factory``` for the dependency injection
and instantiation removes the hassle of dealing with dependency problems since everything is so easy to mock.

### Dependency Container, Factory and FactoryWorker
Instantiate new ```Dependency Container``` and assign it to ```Factory```.
Use ```Factory``` to get instance of your specific ```FactoryWorker```.

The most important thing is, that the dependency tree is built outside of the application, which means that
the classes which are being instantiated with the ```FactoryWorker``` are not aware
about the ```Dependency Container``` at all.

It could be in separate files, obviously, split by the application type and the dependencies it needs.

An example, of using the same instance of ```Logger```, in every class, through out whole application,
which required ```Logger``` dependency.

```php
$Container = new Dependency\Container();
$Factory = new Factory($Container);
$FactoryWorker = $Factory->getWorkerByName('Application', 'MyApplication\Modules\Application\Factory');

$Container->register('Application', function () use ($FactoryWorker) {
    $Logger = $FactoryWorker->getFactory()->getDependencyContainer()->resolve('Logger');
    return $FactoryWorker->buildApplication($Logger);
});

$Container->register('UserManager', function () use ($FactoryWorker) {
    $UserRepository = $FactoryWorker->getFactory()->getDependencyContainer()->resolve('UserRepository');
    $Logger = $FactoryWorker->getFactory()->getDependencyContainer()->resolve('Logger');
    return $FactoryWorker->buildUserManager($UserRepository, $Logger);
});

$Container->register('Logger', function () use ($FactoryWorker) {
    return $FactoryWorker->buildLogger();
});

//..
//.. Instantiate your application, and proceed as usual
//..
$Application = $Container->resolve('Application');
$Application
    ->bootstrap()
    ->run();
```

The only thing, that the application or bootstrap class need to do in order to have an access to its own FactoryWorker,
is to use the FactoryWorker dependency setter trait.

```php
namespace MyApplication\Modules\Application

ues Everon\Component\Factory\Dependency;

class Application
{
    use Dependency\Setter\ApplicationFactoryWorker;
}
```

### What's the best way to inject dependencies?
Use constructor for dependencies that are part of what the class is doing, and use setters/getters for infrastructure type dependencies.
In general, a ```Logger``` or ```FactoryWorker``` could be good examples of infrastructure type dependencies.
